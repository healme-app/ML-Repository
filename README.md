# ML-Repository for HealMe: Skin Disease Detection Application

## Introduction
Welcome to the ML-Repository for HealMe, an application designed for detecting skin diseases using machine learning. This repository contains the model files necessary for running the HealMe application. These files include the model architecture in JSON format and the trained model weights in binary format.

## Repository Structure
The repository contains the following files:

ML-Repository
- model.json
- model_weights.bin

### Files:
- **model.json**: This file contains the architecture of the machine learning model used in HealMe. It describes the layers and configurations of the model in JSON format.
- **model_weights.bin**: This binary file contains the weights of the trained machine learning model. These weights are essential for making predictions using the model.
